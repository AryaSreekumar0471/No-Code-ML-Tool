# No-Code-ML-Tool

A Flask-based no-code machine learning platform designed for healthcare datasets.  
The tool enables users to upload data, preprocess features, handle missing values, balance classes, perform cross-validation, and train models (Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression) â€” **all without writing code**.
